## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many student portfolios tend to be either:
- overly minimal and impersonal, or
- visually attractive but technically shallow.

The goal of this portfolio is to **bridge that gap** by creating a platform that:
- reflects my **technical competence**,
- highlights **real academic and project work**, and
- presents my profile in a **distinct, creative, and professional way** suitable for recruiters, mentors, and collaborators.
